# Andrew Ng Chee Wei

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I’m a final-year Mechatronics Engineering student at Asia Pacific University, passionate about robotics, automation, and emerging intelligent systems.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a goal-driven and highly motivated engineer, with a strong foundation in automation and robotics. My technical experience spans across Linux systems, embedded programming, real-time robot control, and advanced CAD modeling. I actively explore intersections between control theory, machine learning, and real-world robotic platforms. In fact, I aim to develop my own robots as a hobby as well.

## 🚀 Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies | Media |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| [WERDNA](https://github.com/adwng/werdna_ros2) | A self-balancing two-wheeled robot running ROS2. This project has been my challenging project thus far. From 3D printing custom actuators to `custom hardware interfaces`, `custom broadcasters`, and `Sim2Real Transfer`. | ROS2, C++|<img src="assets/Chassis Design.png" alt="Werdna" width="400"/>|
| [WERDNA-GYM](https://github.com/adwng/werdna_gensis) | Custom simulation environment based on Genesis-Embodied-AI framework for reinforcement learning with the WERDNA robot. | Genesis-Embodied-AI, Python, Gym, RL | <img src="assets/Gym.png" alt="Gym Simulation" width="400"/> |
| [PalmVision AGV](https://github.com/adwng/PalmVision) | A smart AGV designed for palm oil fields. Combines low-cost sensors and navigation logic for real-time field coverage and automation. | Python, Computer Vision, Arduino, ROS2 |<img src="assets/PalmVision.jpg" alt="Palmvision" width="400"/>|
